## MightyCoders Data Visualization Tools Wiki

## Overview

The original intent of these tools was to analyze the impact of COVID-19, and the shift to online classes, on our tutors and students, while this remains a goal, the scope has expanded to general tools, that visualize student performance, identify problem areas in the curriculum, and establish company wide metrics. 

These pages provide instructions on how to use the tools and create visuals for the current student data set. The pages also provide detailed explanations of the Python functions that parse, transfer, and analyze the student data, so that these procedures and tools can be integrated into our Learning Management System, and be more readily used by our staff and customers.      

## Use & Setup

   - Required Python 3, check the dependences section for the other libraries used. 

   - Clone or download the repo from Github.  

   - Open and run **`DataVisExample.py`** to get a feeling for the kinds of visuals you can create. Refer to the Data Visualizations page to see all functions available for use.   

     From there data on any student, lesson, or rank can be analyzed with the current data set.
