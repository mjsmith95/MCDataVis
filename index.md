## Overview

The original intent of these tools was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 and the shift to online classes on our company, while this remains a goal, the scope has expanded to general tools, that visualize student performance, identify problem areas in the curriculum, and establish company wide metrics. 

These pages provide instructions on how to use the tools and create visuals for the current student data set. The pages also provide detailed explanations of the Python functions that parse, transfer, and analyze the student data, so that these procedures and tools can be integrated into our Learning Management System, and be more readily used by our staff and customers.      

## Use & Setup

#### Creating Visuals and Performing Data Analysis

- Clone or download the repo from Github.  

   - Check that  **`students.json`**, **`StudentObjectSerializer.py`**, and **`StudentDataVis.py`** are all present in the same directory as the example  script. 

   - Open and run **`DataVisExample.py`** to get a feeling for the kinds of visuals that can be created.

     From there data on any student, lesson, or rank can be analyzed with the current data set. Refer to the Data Visualizations Tools page to see all functions available for use.    

#### Using the Student Object Serializer

- Run **`StudentObjectSerializerExample.py`**  to produce an example output of the formatted student objects in a JSON file, as well as an example student object.    

- To serialize student data into the student objects, a JSON input file is required. This JSON file is usually generated by running the web-scrapper, but updates to the website have broken the HTML path that was used to pull data. Instead use the most up-to-date data included in the project, stored in  **`studentsMCDataMaster.json`**, in the scr folder in the repository.   

- The output file for all students is simply **`students.json`**, this file contains the student objects, that get passed to the data analysis tools. 

  The main function of the Student Object Serializer script is to deserialize the student data in formatted objects, then reserialize those objects so that data analysis can be performed efficiently without having to run a web scrapped or re format data every time the data needs to be visualized.  

## Data Set Information

The current data set was generated on **10/1/2020** . The data set contains **254** students, any student with zero time spent on courses , or zero courses has been removed by the object creation and serialization steps. 

### Note

- Repository is written in python 3.8
- To see the current TODO tasks check the readme.md file in the main branch. 
- Current dependencies are `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `os`, `sys`, `json`, and `datetime`.
